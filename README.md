# Find-my-car
Bachelor's final year thesis project made in Arduino IDE.

Project was made for the Arduino UNO board with SIM 808 GSM/GPRS + GPS MODULE.
You should have one SIM card to put it in your SIM 808 module with which you will be able to communicate and six 1.5V batteries to suply your device.

Edit my code in a way that you put your number in the marked place in the code.
Upload your code to the Arduino board, send any message to the inserted SIM card end get device coordinates in the form of 
### Google Maps link.
You can put the device in your car or whatever you want to know the location.
